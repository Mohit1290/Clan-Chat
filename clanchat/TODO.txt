1. set firestore to send data to firestore. start with nickname
2. Design UI For Chatting
3. set realtime database with offline support

NOTES-> Encrypted chats would be fun
        One on One or Group???
        Will have to think this 
        Could use home UI for welcoming user 
        Settings icon for changing password
